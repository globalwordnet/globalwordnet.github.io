The Global Wordnet Association Board would like to announce a change
in the composition of the board.

Francis Bond was elected President, John McCrae vice president and
Erica Biagetti Secretary. Petya Osenova joined as a new member while
Maciej Piasecki and Alexandre Rademaker continue to serve.

We would like to thank German Rigau, who stood down,  for his service as president.

The new board will do its best to keep the wordnet community vibrant and healthy!

Francis (on behalf of the board)
