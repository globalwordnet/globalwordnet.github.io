The Global Wordnet Association is pleased to announce that the 11th
International Global Wordnet Conference (GWC2021will be held from 18 to
21 January 2021 in Pretoria, South Africa. The conference will be hosted
by the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources
(SADiLaR)](https://www.sadilar.org/).  Due to the uncertainty of what
will be the circumstances during the conference as a result of COVID-19,
the venue and format of conference presentation will be announced in due
course.

**COVID19 Pandemic**

Please note that given the current global pandemic and the uncertainty
surrounding international travel in January 2021, the organisers are
also preparing a virtual conference as contingency. A final announcement
as to the format of GWC2021 will be made in October 2020. Should the
conference be hosted as a virtual event, a combination of the approaches
successfully implemented by RAIL2020 and LREC2020 will be used as
roadmap – authors will be asked to prerecord their presentations which
will be streamed during a live virtual event with opportunity for
questions and discussions after each presentation; proceedings will also
be published and a reduced registration fee will be applicable.
