[Bollywood Veggies](http://bollywoodveggies.com/): Bollywood Veggies is
a sanctuary away from the bustle of the “Little Red Dot”. Set in the
rustic environment of the northwest

Kranji Countryside, visiting it is a step back to Singapore’s lush
history. Our location provides a great opportunity to see a fresh side
of the island, rejuvenate your senses and enjoy the simple pleasures of
real food.

Buloh Wetland
Reserve](http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/nature-wildlife/reserves/sungei-buloh-wetland-reserve/):
the wetlands of Sungei Buloh are a dream come true for keen nature
lovers. At this sprawling 87-hectare ecological site, you can catch
migratory birds escaping the cold on their way to the warmer climes of
Australia – with some having come as far away as Siberia. Elsewhere,
crabs, mudskippers and mud lobsters can be found in their natural
habitats, and viewed from a distance at observation posts that dot the
park. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a world-class eco-tourism
experience first discovered in 1986 by a group of birdwatchers from the
Malayan Nature Society. Three years later, the site was designated as a
nature park by the Government in 1989, and officially opened in 1993.
