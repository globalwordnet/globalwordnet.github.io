### [![](http://globalwordnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SeasonofDocs_Icon_Grey_300ppi-whitespace-cropped_480-300x266.png)](http://globalwordnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SeasonofDocs_Icon_Grey_300ppi-whitespace-cropped_480.png)Global WordNet Association has been selected to take part in this year’s [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants?fbclid=IwAR0Z8aG5SQhdnIxS3sbOkd2kAUTk3GLeq2OZfO7Se8DBd7ksQj0cZ1ETvfA). 

Ideas we invite tech writers to work with us on:

-   [Wordnet Structure](https://globalwordnet.github.io/doc/#structure):
    what do the parts of a lexical entry mean?  
    Ideally this should include documentation accessible to users of the
    lexicons as well as developers.
-   [The Open Multilingual Wordnet
    (OMW)](https://globalwordnet.github.io/doc/#omw):  
    Some how-tos:
    -   how to look up words and concepts
    -   how to add a new wordnet project
    -   how to download data
-   [How to contribute a word or concept to a
    wordnet](https://globalwordnet.github.io/doc/#contrib):
    -   Minimal required information
    -   Desired information
    -   Structure of definitions
