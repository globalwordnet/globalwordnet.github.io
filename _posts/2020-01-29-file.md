title: "NEW: GWA has now working groups on specific themes that you can follow or join"
---

GWA is calling for volunteered working groups to work on issues that
matter for the WordNet community. Through these working groups we hope
to ‘bind’ the community and to continue our work in a collaborative
spirit to benefit from each other’s work. We expect working group to
report on their progress and results through regular updates on their
web page. At the next Global Wordnet Conference, we would like to
present the results to the audience in the business meeting.

So follow or join the working groups on specific themes now. More
information can be found here:
