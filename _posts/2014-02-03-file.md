title: Coverage GWA Proceedings in Elsevier products
---

Elsevier is happy to inform us that the proceedings from the
International Global WordNet Conference (2006, 2008, 2012, onward) have
been accepted for coverage in selected Elsevier product(s)\*. They
intend to index and extract data from selected full text articles and
integrate such data in these product(s). Coverage in Elsevier product(s)
increases dissemination of authors’ work via linking technologies, which
drive additional traffic to individual articles, promoting journal brand
awareness, subscription, and pay-per-view sales. In short, the benefits
are high visibility to a global audience, fast online dissemination of
content and increased exposure and profile for authors, editors and your
publishing organization. Please be assured that although they require
access to the full text of the publication for indexation and extraction
purposes, they never make the full text available to our customers or
any other third parties.
