I am pleased to announce that the Proceedings of GWC 2025 are now available in the ACL anthology:  https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2025.gwc-1/

Thanks to Erica Biagetti, Luca Brigada Villa and Chiara Zanchi, with  a little help from Alexandre Rademaker and myself, and Matt Post from the ACL anthology.

Also, thanks to the kind endorsement of the ACL special interest groups on the lexicon and computational semantics (SIGLEX and SIGSEM), ACL has assigned us DOIs, not just for this year but for all years currently archived (2014-2025: https://aclanthology.org/venues/gwc/).  Thanks again to Alexandre Rademaker for his hard work in adding the older proceedings.


Francis (on behalf of the board)
