Global Wordnet Association Board would like to announce a change in the
composition of the board. 

Christiane Fellbaum and Piek Vossen have decided to take a well deserved
break from running the GWA since they founded it in 2000. They have
stepped down as co-chairs, but agreed to stay on to guide us with their
wisdom as ex-officio members.

the next conference (which should be in January 2023) German Rigau,
Francis Bond and Maciej Piasecki have volunteered to step up as pro-tem
president, vice-president and secretary.  At the next conference we will
hold board elections, following the guidelines in the constitution.

Our first act will be to call for bids for the 2021 conference,

German and Francis (on behalf of the board)
