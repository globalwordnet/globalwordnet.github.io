    We invite papers addressing the topics listed, but not limited to, the ones below. Proposals for tutorials on building wordnets and demonstrations of wordnet databases, and wordnet-based software are welcome too.

           1. Linguistics and lexical semantics, including:

                  * In depth analysis of semantic relations
                  * Determining and representing word meanings (definitions, relations,
                    semantic components, co-occurrence statistics, etc.)
                  * Necessity and completeness issues
                  * Ontologies and wordnets
                  * The lexicon and wordnets
                  * Distributional semantic approaches
                  * Cross-lingual representation of meaning
                  * Similarity and relatedness

           2. Architecture of lexical databases, including:

                  * Language independent and language dependent components
                  * Integration of multi-wordnets in research infrastructures (like CLARIN) and 
                    LT networks (like META-NET)

           3. Tools and Methods for wordnet Development, including:

                  * User and Data entry interface, organization
                  * Extending and enriching wordnets 

           4. Wordnet and applications including:

                  * Word sense disambiguation using wordnet
                  * Information extraction and retrieval

                  * Sentiment Analysis
                  * Automatic hyperlinking
                  * Language teaching

           5. Standardization, distribution and availability of wordnets and wordnet tools. 

    In conjunction with the conference we intend to hold two workshops: one on distributional semantics and one on technology enhanced learning.

    Presentations will fall into one of the following categories:

        * long papers (30 mins)
        * short papers (15 mins)
        * project reports (10 mins)
        * demonstrations (20 mins) 

    Submissions should be anonymous and will have to state one of the preferred categories. Acceptance may be subject to changes in the category of the presentation, e.g. a long paper submission may be accepted as a short paper.

    In addition, we will reserve some time for lightning talks and discussions.

    Final papers should be submitted in electronic form (PDF only):

      * Long papers should be limited to 8 pages,
      * Demonstration papers must be at most 5 pages text and can have additional 3 pages screen dumps or
        images;
      * Short papers and project descriptions should be limited to 5 pages.

    Page limits do not include references.
