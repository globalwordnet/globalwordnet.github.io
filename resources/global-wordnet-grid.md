# Global WordNet Grid

# Introduction

At the 3rd GWA Conference in Korea, we launched the idea to start
building a completely free worldwide wordnet grid. This grid will be
build around a shared set of concepts, such as the [Common Base
Concepts](http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/gwa_base_concepts.htm) used
in many wordnet projects. These concepts will be expressed in terms of
Wordnet synsets and [SUMO](http://www.ontologyportal.org/) terms. We
invite people from all language communities to upload synsets from their
language to the Grid. Gradually, the Grid will then be represented by
all languages.

**[Francis Bond](mailto:bond@ieee.org) has taken this idea and created
the [Open Multilingual
Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/ "Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW)"),
which links those concepts that are shared with the Princeton Wordnet.**

The Grid is free and language contributions must therefore be provided
under one of the following open licenses to be included:

-   A license containing the words “This work is released into the
    public domain by: ” and without any other license text
-   The [Princeton WordNet
    license](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/license) (with appropriate
    substitutions for the name of the institution and without any other
    license text)
-   [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY
    4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ "CC BY 4.0") (or

    4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ "CC BY-SA 4.0") (or
    earlier versions)
-   Or other [open licences](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/) (as
    defined by [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/about/))

To submit your contribution to the Grid, please send the synsets of your
language to:

-   [Piek Vossen](mailto:piek.vossen@planet.nl) or [Francis
    Bond](mailto:bond@ieee.org)

We will place your language in the Grid as soon as possible!

The list of languages currently in the grid is given
