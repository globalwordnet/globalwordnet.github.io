# Working Groups

GWA is calling for volunteered working groups to work on issues that
matter for the WordNet community. Through these working groups we hope
to ‘bind’ the community and to continue our work in a collaborative
spirit to benefit from each other’s work. We expect working group to
report on their progress and results through regular updates on their
web page. At the next Global Wordnet Conference, we would like to
present the results to the audience in the business meeting.

 

This page lists the current working groups. Follow the links or mail the
coordinators to find out more about each or if you want to be involved.
