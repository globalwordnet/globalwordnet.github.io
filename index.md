### Global WordNet Grid

The building of a completely free worldwide [Global WordNet
Grid](/resources/global-wordnet-grid), which
will be build around a shared set of concepts used in many wordnet
projects.

We invite people from all language communities to upload synsets from
their language to the Grid. Gradually, the Grid will then be represented
by all languages.
